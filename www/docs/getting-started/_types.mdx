For Tsynamo's type-safety and autocompletion to work, it needs to know your
database structure. This requires a TypeScript <code>DDB</code>
interface, that contains table names as keys and table schema interfaces as
values.

**Let's define our first database interface:**

```ts title="types.ts"
import { PartitionKey, SortKey } from "tsynamo";

export interface DDB {
  UserEvents: {
    userId: PartitionKey<string>; // It is important to mark the Partition Key as it enables Tsynamo to help you from messing up
    eventId: SortKey<number>;
    eventType: string;
    userAuthenticated: boolean;
  };
  Users: {
    userId: PartitionKey<string>;
    userName: string;
  }
}
```

:::tip Multiple Tables
Note that you can have multiple tables in the DDB schema. Nested attributes are supported too.
:::

:::tip Codegen (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

For production apps, it is recommended to automatically generate your <code>DDB</code>
interface by introspecting your production database.

:::info Runtime types

Tsynamo only deals with types in the typescript level. Tsynamo never touches the runtime output types in
any way.
